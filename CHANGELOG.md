# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project aims to
follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Project scaffold: docs, package skeleton, CI, license.
- Design and architecture documentation ported from the office-hours design doc
  and the engineering review (see `docs/`).

### Changed
- Input foundation switched from a forked gtnh-flow (Python) to consuming
  gtnh-factory-flow's MIT, Zod-validated exported plan JSON. The adapter now parses
  that documented export (no vendoring); recipes/throughput/machine-IDs come from its
  dataset, so the hand-authored physical dataset shrinks. Removed the `vendor/`
  placeholder in favor of `examples/` for sample exported plans.
